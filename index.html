            <p>
                Hi! I'm Mark, and I enjoy building cool things. Beyond the digital world, I'm captivated by surgical techniques and orthopedics. As I journey through these fields, I continually seek intersections and synergies between them. Previously, I was an officer in the Singapore Armed Forces and led infrastructure upgrades at the camp I was in.

                <li><a href="www.orthospinesg.com">OrthoSpine SG</a> Along with my 2 brothers, we built a static website for patients to learn more about the orthopedic and spine clinic in Singapore. The "contact us" page has a form that emails the clinic when a patient fills in their details.  </li>
